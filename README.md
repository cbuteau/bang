# bang
Extensible utility library


## Concept

I dreamed about this driving one day.
What if instead of using underscore or jquery or whatever you said load this library for its clone.

Ad I imagined using the ! as a variable name and calling it bang.
But that is not a valid variable name...and it is still called bang.


## Usage

The library will configure with some defaults.
But will be able to recall the configure method.


## Status

Found out Node JS cannot load libraries from a CDN...will have to think upon this more.
